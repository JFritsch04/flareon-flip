# Flareon Flip

  
  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to re-create a game with the inspiration of Voltorb Flip from Pokemon Heartgold and Soulsilver. There were a lot of challenges and success in this project. Challenges included interfacing the game code with the game view in a functional manner, making sure all the routes connected with one another and are working correct, fixing styling issues with bootstrap/handlebars. Successes included utilizing handlebars to get dynamic data, setting up the databases, getting the appearance of the game, and the game development. The technologies we used included Express, MySQL, Sequelize, CSS/Bootstrap, SweetAlert2, Handlebars, Elfsight, and Railway.
